# UCSC_Astro136

Scripts created and commented for UCSC course Astro 136, Advanced Astronomy Laboratory. This class consisted of two projects: the Pluto distance measurement project where students create a data reduction pipeline using data retrieved by Lick Observatory's Nickel 1-meter Telescope; and the Dark Matter project where students prove the existence of dark matter through calculating the velocity curve of a galaxy using data retrieved by Lick Observatory's KAST Shane Telescope.


The Pluto data is under directories Night1 and Night2. The Dark Matter data is under directory Spectra. It is recommended to use SAOImageDS9 to view the .fits files: https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9. Some tips on maneuvering ds9 are included as comments in the notebooks.
