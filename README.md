# UCSC_Astro136

Scripts created and commented for UCSC course Astro 136, Advanced Astronomy Laboratory. This class consisted of two projects: the Pluto distance measurement project where students create a data reduction pipeline using data retrieved by Lick Observatory's Nickel 1-meter Telescope; and the Dark Matter project where students prove the existence of dark matter through calculating the velocity curve of a galaxy using data retrieved by Lick Observatory's KAST Shane Telescope.
